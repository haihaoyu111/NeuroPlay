# NeuroGame: EEG-Based Brain Oscillation Analysis in Athletic Decision-Making

## 🧠 Overview

**NeuroGame** is a research-driven framework that investigates the neural mechanisms underlying decision-making in sports using advanced EEG signal analysis. By analyzing brain oscillations, especially theta and gamma bands, we aim to uncover cognitive processes that influence reaction time and decision accuracy in athletes.

This project introduces an innovative framework that combines:

- **Athlete-Centric Performance Analysis Network (ACPAN):** A multi-modal deep learning system designed to capture spatiotemporal brain activity.
- **Dynamic Performance Optimization Strategy (DPOS):** A feedback-driven module for real-time training adaptation based on EEG insights.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 EEG-based signal processing for brain oscillation analysis
- 🤖 Deep learning models for spatiotemporal pattern recognition
- ⚡ Real-time performance optimization strategy
- 🧩 Integration of decision accuracy, reaction time, and brainwave activity
- 🏋️ Athlete-centered training adaptation based on neurofeedback

## 🧪 Methodology

### 1. EEG Signal Collection & Preprocessing
- Multi-channel EEG devices record brain activity during sports decision-making tasks
- Noise reduction, artifact removal, and frequency band separation (theta, gamma)

### 2. ACPAN: Athlete-Centric Performance Analysis Network
- Multi-modal data integration (EEG + behavioral metrics)
- Deep neural network for modeling spatial and temporal dependencies

### 3. DPOS: Dynamic Performance Optimization Strategy
- Real-time interpretation of model outputs
- Adaptive training feedback for optimizing decision-making efficiency

## 📈 Key Findings

- **Theta Oscillations (4–7 Hz):** Strongly linked to cognitive control and attention during high-pressure decisions.
- **Gamma Oscillations (30–80 Hz):** Associated with sensory integration and faster reaction times.
- **Neural Patterns ↔ Performance Metrics:** Brainwave dynamics provide reliable predictors of decision accuracy and speed.
